# services
The `services` folder is meant for all back-end processes, and contains methods in order to access external or interal services.

Currently, we can find:
```
* MapboxClient.ts     // A back-end service to interact with Mapbox
* SupabaseClient.ts   // A back-end service to interact with Supabase
```
